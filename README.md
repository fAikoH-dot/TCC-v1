# Previsão de custos e preços de commodities agrícolas

## This work focuses on the price forecasting of agricultural crops such as cotton, soybeans, corn, and wheat, aiming to obtain data up to two years in advance using statistical models and machine learning to assist producers in their strategic market positioning by estimating the prices of these commodities. To achieve this, an exploratory data analysis was conducted on the data obtained from the prices of these crops to find traces of seasonality and variables that provide significant improvements to the predictive model. Simple statistical algorithms, such as Linear Regression, and advanced ones, such as Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), as well as algorithms that apply Machine Learning like XGBoost, were explored. The results obtained using the ARIMA and PROPHET models were selected after analyzing the metrics, as well as the trends of the predicted curves and the study of the market over the past few years and how it reacts to global economic instabilities.
